# libcw

libcw is a personal set of pure C utility libraries to help make up for
the languages lack of a modern standard library. It implements a simple
arena allocator and builds on top of that a sort of psuedo standard library
complete with dynamic arrays, strings, something resembling async/await,
and anything else I can think to throw in here.

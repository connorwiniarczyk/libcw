# libcw

libcw is a library I wrote for myself to make programming in C more productive
and enjoyable. C, despite being very old and flawed, C has remained one of the
best programming languages, and has slowly made itself my favorite to work in.
That being said, the C standard library is really not very good, and I've found it
to be too painful to use for basically anything non-trivial.
